<p>
  This project had been started as a python REST library for kaa.
  after project had grew, we decided to complete it as stand alone middleware.
</p>
<p>
  In the begining we used <a href="https://github.com/eljalalpour/SDN101">SDN101</a> project, which is a gread memory for Parham Alvani
  good old days, as a good example of python REST API client.
</p>
<p>
  When 18.20 was leaving us alone, we created improved version of 18.20. this version had its burial with Aolab in 2017.
<p>
  Finally Bamboo is raised from the ashes of Aolab by Bambil open source organization of Iman Tabrizian who is architectural designer of Bamboo.
