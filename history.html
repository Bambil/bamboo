    <h3>History ...</h3>
    <p>
    This project had been started as a python REST library for kaa but after project grew,
    we decided to complete it as stand alone middleware.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the begining we use <a href="https://github.com/eljalalpour/SDN101">SDN101</a> project as a good example of python REST API client.
    SDN101 is a great memory for Parham Alvani good old days.
    </p>
    <p>
    When 18.20 decide to leave us alone, we created improved version of it, in this version we provide everything you need in simple package
    and this middleware started.
    <p>
    After many weeks of development this project found a new idea from our friend and developer Iman Tabrizian and we switched to version 2.
    Parham Alvani had personal issues for using non-GPL packages and protocols but he finally tried to forget the past and we finally use MQTT
    protocol and removed yaml from our project ... version 3.
