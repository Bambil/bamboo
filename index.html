      <h3>History ...</h3>
      <p>
      This project had been started as a python REST library for kaa but after project grew,
      we decided to complete it as stand alone middleware.
      </p>
      <p>
      In the begining we use <a href="https://github.com/eljalalpour/SDN101">SDN101</a> project as a good example of python REST API client.
      SDN101 is a great memory for Parham Alvani good old days.
      </p>
      <p>
      When 18.20 decide to leave us alone, we created improved version of it, in this version we provide everything you need in simple package
      and this middleware started.
      <p>
      After many weeks of development this project found a new idea from our friend and developer Iman Tabrizian and we switched to version 2.
      Parham Alvani had personal issues for using non-GPL packages and protocols but he finally tried to forget the past and we finally use MQTT
      protocol and removed yaml from our project ... version 3.
